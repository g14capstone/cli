# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is built using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/). Use the following command to get started with the CLI:

```bash
python3 main.py --help
```


## Testing

pytest docs can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). See basic run instructions below (should work from root dir or test dir):

```bash
# following cmds should collect all tests and run them, with default verbosity

python3 -m pytest

# or

pytest
```
